## GolfJourney - Unity
Small 2D Physics Platformer game released on Google Play back in 2018. As simple as launching the ball towards the hole.

I had plans to start development again. Redesign and establish a game loop, add new content, improving/refactoring the existing code...
However, I came up with a different idea of what the game should be, moving away altogether from the golf theme.
